## Description 

This is simply just a demo where I created classes and objects for a roleplaying game that is provided by the university.

These classes will have basic variables such as names, etc. as well as some basic interactions. Inheritance classes was used to create these classes. The hierarchy of the inheritance classes is shown below.

## Installation

Go onto Github, find the project and clone the repository.
Afterwards, open bash, locate the destinated file with 'cd', and use git clone on the cloned repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aanassor1/Roleplaying-Game-C-Classes-Demo.git
```

Then, use the makefile to compile the C++ files and then run the .exe  that is created.
